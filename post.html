                            <p class="fs-6">New Valorant Agents are added every few months, so deciding which Agents to unlock as a new player can become quite the conundrum. The meta shifts with every act, and so the recommended Agents to unlock first as a beginner will change, too. As you come fresh into the game, here’s a list of the best beginner Agents in Valorant, that balances ease of use and effectiveness within the context of the current meta.

                                For a comprehensive breakdown of what Agents are and what each of them do, check out this Agent guide.</p>

                            You have 5 Agents unlocked to start with: Brimstone, Jett, Phoenix, Sova, and Sage. Of these 5, two are duelists (Jett and Phoenix), while the other 3 fall into the other 3 categories of Agents (Brimstone for Controller, Sova for Initiator, and Sage for Sentinel).

After playing with the beginning 5 Agents you might have an idea of what type of play style suits you best. As a refresher, see the categories of Agents and who in each category you can unlock.

                                Sentinels: If you enjoyed playing passively with Sage — and preferred assisting your team by being in the backlines or locking down a site — a Sentinel may be good for you. You can unlock Cypher, Killjoy, or Chamber.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Initiators: If you enjoyed assisting your teammates as Sova by setting your team up to get kills or push for map control, an Initiator may be good for you. You can unlock Breach, Skye, KAY/O, or Fade.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Controllers: If you enjoyed playing Brimstone by blocking lines of sight that helped you and your team take the map control you wanted, a Controller may be good for you. You can unlock Viper, Omen, or Astra.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Duelists: With great power comes great responsibility — if you enjoyed Jett and Phoenix, are confident in your ability to get kills and apply pressure to the enemy, a Duelist may be good for you. You can unlock Raze, Reyna, Yoru, or Neon.
                            </li>
